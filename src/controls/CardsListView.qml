/**
 * CardsListView is a ListView which can have AbstractCard as its delegate: it will
 * automatically assign the proper spacings and margins around the cards adhering
 * to the design guidelines.
 * CardsListView should be used only with cards which can look good at any
 * horizontal size, so It is recommended to use directly AbstractCard with an
 * appropriate layout inside, because they are stretching for the whole list width.
 * Therefore is discouraged to use it with the Card type, unless it has
 * Horizontal as headerOrientation.
 * The choice between using this view with AbstractCard or a normal ListView
 * with AbstractListItem/BasicListItem is purely a choice based on aesthetics alone.
 * It is discouraged to tweak the properties of this ListView.
